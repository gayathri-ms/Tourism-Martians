The Temple has an inscription that expounds on the history of the place. According to it, there was a Temple dedicated to Lord Venkateshwara in Tiruchanur originally. Since it was quite cramped, it was difficult for priests to perform rituals and all activity was moved to another premise. Eventually, only two important rituals were performed at the original site. Over time, even this stopped and the place faded into insignificance. However, in the 12th century, it again came into the limelight when the Yadava kings built the Shri Krishna Balaram Temple here. Later, in the 16th and 17th centuries, the deity of Sundara Varadaraja was installed and a Temple was built for Goddess Padmavati. Legend has it that the goddess was born in a lotus pond that is now a tank within the Temple.",

The Temple draws huge footfalls during a six-day-long festival celebrated in the month of January every year. The backwaters of Ezhumanthruruth are another attraction that can be explored by taking a ride in traditional cargo boats called kettuvallams and witnessing the majestic beauty of the place while cruising through crisscrossing canals. The waterways were earlier used to transport goods from Alappuzha to Kaduthututhy and now connect Kallara with other important tourist places like Kumarakom. Many private tour operators are available to take you through the tranquil water bodies of Kallara.",

It is a popular destination for birdwatching as migratory birds flock here in large numbers from Siberia and the Himalayas. The best season to visit the sanctuary is between June and August as it is the breeding season of wetland birds like white ibis, herons, egrets, Indian darters and kingfishers. Some other not-to-be-missed avian breeds one can spot are wood beetles, larks, flycatchers, parrots, teals, Siberian cranes, owls, water duck and waterfowls. An intriguing way to visit the sanctuary is on a boat trip that gives a closer look of the birds flocking around the water body. For a more comprehensive experience, tourists can stay in independent cottages on stilts at the backwater resort of Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC).",
